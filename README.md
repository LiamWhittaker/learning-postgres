# learning-postgres
This was originally supposed to be a follow-along of Traversy Media's [Recipe App Using Node.js and Postgresql](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFiqctkoVJ4), however I found it to be outdated so I'm going it alone. After a bit of research I decided to use Sequelize instead of node-postgres, and BulmaCSS instead of Bootstrap.
